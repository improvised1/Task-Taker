 Design Notes
 
 - variable parent is required for alot of methods to run, but there where issues saving it, and so NoteCollectionViewController has to pass RepeatingNote a new copy of itself for parent each time we load a RepeatingNote.  Since parent won't exist for initialization from saving, as its set later, this means that two crucial variables, notes and nextNote, also can't be set until we receive parent.  This means that whenever loadRepeatingNotes is called in NoteCollectionViewController, it must be immediately followed by setting the parent variable and calling runCheckup() method, which will do additional setup work.
